## Fastq_clean
### designed to efficiently clean sequencing data

Fastq_clean is a powerful and efficient software solution is first designed to help researchers and scientists clean Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data obtained from the Illumina sequencer. The software is optimised to batch process large amounts of data with a single command line, making the process fast and convenient. In addition, Fastq_clean has been shown to outperform existing NGS data cleaning software in terms of processing Illumina data. The Fastq_clean version 2.0 has brought a significant upgrade with the inclusion of support for PacBio sequencing data.

Fastq_clean is easily accessible and available for download from the Github repository at https://github.com/gaoshanT/Fastq_clean. You may also be obtained at https://app.box.com/s/v7sjjmjo56r71k8bvqkv. Chinese users have the option to download Fastq_clean from the file-sharing platform at http://pan.baidu.com/s/1sjllrcD.

It is important to note that the use of Fastq_clean is limited to non-commercial purposes only. As such, users are kindly asked to cite the software in any related published papers or presentations. This not only gives credit to us, but also helps to spread awareness of the software and its capabilities within the scientific community.
